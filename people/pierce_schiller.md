Pierce Schiller is CEO at SparkCo. Before graduating from Harvard Business School, Pierce founded a number of startups in the Biotech space. He is classically trained as a bioengineer, and most recently was CEO of TarDisk, a technology company that released the worlds first plug and play hybrid drive. It’s not uncommon to see Pierce in a white t-shirt and motorcycle glasses. In his free, time Pierce enjoys fishing and spending time in the water, but that’s only when he’s not cooking up new ideas for things to build.
