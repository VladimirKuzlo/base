## Business Model
Qlink aims to build worldâ€™s first decentralised mobile network coverage, reduce the cost of telecom infrastructures and reward users for sharing unused network assets. Currently, there is no competitors in this specific project. By utilizing blockchain technology, Qlink applies digital identities to telecoms assets, repackage those assets and records the usage footprint of each assets to a distributed ledger. Additionally, Qlink aims to launch applications designed to allow p2p sharing assets including WiFi, mobile data access and E2P SMS. While improving the efficiency of existing network, Qlink plans to launch its custom base station, including a model suitable for vehicle installation. By utilizing the ideal resources of the network equipment, these base stations will allow users to become part of the crypto economy and at the same time create a decentralised solution to cover network black spots.
