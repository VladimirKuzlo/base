## Business Model
Devery.io is developing the Devery Protocol, a decentralized verification platform that enables marking
and tracking over the Ethereum network. The protocol allows manufacturers, brands, retailers and any
other party to assign unique signatures to any products, services or digital goods sold, issued and traded
online. The unique signatures are stored on the Ethereum network and can be queried to determine
contextual data (including location, date, manufacturer/point-of-origin and the identification of the
verifying party). Verification is not limited to the sale of physical goods and services, and can be
extended to verifying the authenticity and legitimacy of any digital goods and services (such as
certificates and courses).
The protocol is the base layer of the Devery ecosystem. It can be used to build application level
verification services and can be integrated with any existing e-commerce stores, applications or services.
This fosters a competitive market of third-party verification services for specialty commercial markets,
such as the clothing and apparel industry, technology, food markets, raw materials, education and other
digitally sold goods and services.
An operational token, the Entry Verification Engine (EVE), is the engine that powers the protocol. The
EVE token is required to generate unique signatures and contextual data on the protocol. Any
application that builds on top of the Devery protocol requires the user to spend EVE tokens, which are
received by the owner of the application as a fee for their verification services.
