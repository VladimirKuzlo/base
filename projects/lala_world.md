## Business Model
The commissions and fees charged by the intermediaries for the financial services averages around 7-10%. Using blockchain, we can reduce this substantially by cutting down all the intermediaries for these services and reducing the commission to around 2%. This facilitates financial services for the underbanked and underserved who are deprived of basic financial services.
