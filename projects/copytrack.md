## Business Model
COPYTRACK will set the precedent for a global, transparent and decentralized register for copyrights of digital content. Currently, COPYTRACK’s services are geared towards searching for their customers’ images across the web. If there is a successful match, they then move forward with enforcement and licensing. Now COPYTRACK will expand their services to include registering images via the blockchain and provide a new marketplace for artists and buyers. At the same time, COPYTRACK will implement the first usecase for the decentralized ledger: The Global Copyright Register for Images - other external business models are free to interface with the open ledger.
