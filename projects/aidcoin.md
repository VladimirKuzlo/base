## Business Model
AidCoin is an ERC20 utility token that allows people to donate to charities while easily tracking their donations on a public ledger (AIDChain). AidCoin also allows charities to integrate a donation button (AIDPay) on their website that enables the acceptance of crypto currencies for their fundraising campaigns. People can donate in any crypto currency or altcoins that will be converted into AidCoin at the current exchange rate.The online donation market is $15bn in the US alone. The rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies will definitely impact the way to donate in the future and AidCoin is set to play a leading role in this new era of fundraising.
