## Business Model
The scalable blockchain-based platform that enables consumers to buy groceries directly from manufacturers at lower prices, with convenience. The INS concept is validated by consumer interest and received strong support from manufacturers. They signed memoranda with Unilever, Reckitt Benckiser, Valio, FrieslandCampina and MARS. All manufacturers will be able to list and sell products directly to consumers, gain customer feedback and reward loyal customers. Smart contracts power loyalty programs, blockchain makes the supply chain more efficient and trims costs.
