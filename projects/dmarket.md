## Business Model
Dmarket is a global marketplace based on blockchain and smart contracts. It will enable one-click sale, exchange or evaluation of every virtual item between all games on any platform. Using our API every game developer will easily connect their game to Dmarket. Users will finally enter the global economy with virtual items. Game developers will gain from increased lifetime value, revenue, and time spent in their games. The decentralized blockchain of Dmarket is the technology to ensure 100% security and safety. Smart contracts are the bridge on blockchain to connect all game worlds and universes together without any third-party needed. They will log change of ownership and automatically transfer payments.
