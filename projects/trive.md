## Business Model
Trive™ is a Nash Equilibrium Global Consensus engine that researches and clarifies Truth through Human Swarmed crowd wisdom using blockchain based rewards and verification mechanisms. Using crowdsourced research, game theory and cryptocurrencies it will enable people all over the world to research, verify and score the truth of almost any piece of knowledge. We implement this by using game theory, blockchain and cryptocurrency to incent rational behavior. The resulting effort is hashed/stashed to the blockchain via a smart contract to ensure the sanctity of the Truth Hive (Trive™) process.
