## Business Model
Ripio Credit Network (“RCN​”) is a protocol based on smart contracts and blockchain
technology, which brings enhanced transparency and reliability in credit and lending.
The protocol enables connections between lenders and borrowers located anywhere in
the world, regardless of currency. By reducing the traditional banking brokerage costs
and management fees, RCN aims to allow better conditions for both sides, creating a
better credit alternative than anything available today. By including an intermediary
agent (the “Cosigner​”), the RCN seeks to neutralize the lender’s credit risk and, in case
of a default, provide an alternative mechanism for managing the debt collection in the
borrower’s country of residence.
