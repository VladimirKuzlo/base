## Business Model
Mirocana is a complex predicting system based on deep-learning neural nets that collect, store and analyse huge volumes of financial data. We created three investment products based on system's predictions for stock, currency and crypto-currency markets. Access to these products is restricted by amount of tokens on customer's account. MIRO token is an data access object for Mirocana Investment Products. Also MIRO tokens are used by the system to encourage talented people to contribute their knowledge and code for the propose of increasing the accuracy of Mirocana predictions. MIRO tokens can be purchased during a Token Sale, or after at the Exchange.
